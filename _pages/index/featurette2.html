<h2 class="featurette-heading" style="margin-top: 0px;">On the 14th February 2014 <span class="text-muted">we are fundraising for the children of Syria</span></h2>
<p class="lead">Syria - 130,000 dead, 575,000+ injured, 2 million refugees outside Syria and 4 million displaced inside Syria with 1000s suffering starvation and lack of shelter. We&#39;ve seen the pictures in the news, we&#39;ve watched BBC Panorama&#39;s Children of Syria, we MUST do something to help. Every little counts.<br />
Swan Love is fundraising for the children of Syria this Valentine&#39;s Day. On the most romantic day of the year we are urging you to come and share your love and show your love for a different reason - to raise money for Syria with the charity <a href="http://www.handinhandforsyria.org.uk/" target="_blank">Hand in Hand for Syria</a>.<br />
The tickets are &pound;10 and we promise you an evening of fun and entertainment with some of Yorkshire&#39;s best artists, dancers and DJs.</p>
