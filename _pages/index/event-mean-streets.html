	<p class="lead">We team up with Simon on the Streets who offer street-based support for those in need. This charity works across Leeds, Huddersfield and Bradford providing front-line emotional and practical support for those who need it.</p>
	<p>Your ticket purchase will help provide funds which offer individual support to those who are homeless; at risk of becoming homeless; those with behavioural and mental health issues; and those who are struggling with an addiction.</p>
	<p>Simon on the Streets aims to be there for these people and help them to access the services that they need to make positive changes to their lives.<br />
		Simon on the Streets remembers and engages those that so many forget.</p>
