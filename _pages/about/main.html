        <h3>Ruby Paul</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.rubypaul.com/" target="_blank">Ruby Paul</a> loved to sing from an early age - standing in a corner to perform to anyone who would listen. However, her childhood dream was to play the harp.</p>

        <p>After selling her viola and graduating with a Music Degree from York University, Ruby invested in a 31 string harp and after a stint of busking, she played folk clubs and festivals. Ruby now has two new harps: a 34 string Clarsach, and a large glossy Black Camac Pedal Harp, her pride and joy.</p>

        <p>Ruby has produced three albums with her own material and performed at International Harp Festivals, at The Edinburgh Festival and BBC Look North. With a wide repertoire encompassing Classical, Pop and Folk, Ruby's passion is to mould her own unique arrangements of songs old and new and to create new music.</p>

        <h3>Alexandra Parker</h3>
        <p>Alexandra began playing at weddings quite a few years ago now and the feeling was indescribable. The first time she played at a wedding she was 14 years old and absolutely loved it! She recalls playing 'Perfect Moment' as the bride stepped out of the wedding car. When she heard the music, in that moment Alexandra saw a tear of the purest happiness imaginable. It was her day and she had helped to make it the most wonderful memory. She felt so amazing to have touched someone that much. From that moment, she knew what she wanted to do for the rest of her life.</p>
