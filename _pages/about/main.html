              <p>Maz is the founder and creative director of Swan Love. With over 10 years events experience organising The Seaside Tribe parties a move to Leeds was not going to stop him. During the summer of 2013 he read a book by Trueman Capote called 'Party of the Century' This book inspired him to party again and Swan Love was born. Our aim is to attract the most beautiful and talented musicians, artists and dancers to party together to help great causes.</p>
