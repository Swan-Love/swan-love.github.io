	Our launch party is in aid of Hand in Hand for Syria. The goal is to raise as much funds to help purchase medicines to supply the children needs. Even if you cannot make the event we urge you to donate to the justgiving link.

	<p style="padding: 25px;">We recently had a meeting with a local Leeds charity called Simon on the Streets which helps the homeless. Swan Love plans a masked summer ball and will once again raise awareness and needed funds to help this worthy cause.
