<h3>Alexandra Parker</h3>
		
		<p>Alexandra began playing at weddings quite a few years ago now and the feeling was indescribable. The first time she played at a wedding she was 14 years old and absolutely loved it! She recalls playing &#39;Perfect Moment&#39; as the bride stepped out of the wedding car. When she heard the music, in that moment Alexandra saw a tear of the purest happiness imaginable. It was her day and she had helped to make it the most wonderful memory. She felt so amazing to have touched someone that much. From that moment, she knew what she wanted to do for the rest of her life.</p>
