        <h3>Ruby Paul</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.rubypaul.com/" target="_blank">Ruby Paul</a> loved to sing from an early age- standing in a corner to perform to anyone who would listen!  She then took instrumental lessons and made good progress on piano and viola. Despite musical success, Ruby regretted that she had not fulfilled a dream that she had had since childhood to play a harp.  She was told at the age of 10, that it was far too expensive!</p>
        <p>So she sold her viola and bought a modest a 31 string harp. After graduating with a Music Degree from York University, she initially busked on the streets of York accompanying traditional folk and self penned songs on the harp. She quickly graduated from busking to bookings in folk clubs and festivals. After some success in her career as a gigging performer for venues, private events and weddings, Ruby was able to invest in two new harps: a 34 string Clarsach, and finally a large glossy Black Camac Pedal Harp, her pride and joy. </p>
        <p>Ruby has showcased her work, including three albums of original material, at top venues all over the country, at International Harp Festivals, at The Edinburgh Festival and on BBC Look North. With a wide repertoire encompassing Classical, Pop and Folk, Ruby's passion is to mould her own unique arrangements of songs old and new, and to create new music, particularly music fit for ambient settings. Drawing on her soft and mellow vocal style, her music has a flowing melodic focus.</p>

        <h3>Alexandra Parker</h3>
        <p>I began playing at weddings quite a few years ago now, the feeling was indescribable. The first time that I played at a wedding, I was 14 years old, and I absolutely loved it! I remember playing 'Perfect Moment', and as the bride stepped out of the wedding car, she heard the music and in that moment I saw a tear of the purest happiness imaginable. It was her day and I had helped to make it the most wonderful memory. It felt so amazing to have touched someone that much. From that moment, I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.</p>
